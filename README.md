# Fortune500 Analysis

INTRODUCTION


In today's world of data, market and corporate analysis has taken a new turn with researchers studying the sample data of large firms. This analysis depends upon various factors such as firm's monetary performance, nature of business, market risks etc. Following on the same note, I will be working with Fortune500 dataset from the year 2017 which ranks the greatest corporations by revenue for their corresponding financial years. In this report the target is to first perform feature selection and then compare different styles of regression models â€“ Multivariable Linear Regression, Polynomial, Ridge and LASSO. I will also predict the profit values and draw a contrast between the model performances and accuracy in reference to the original profit values. This dataset can be used for exploratory analysis on the companies and give insights like: What role does ranking play in profitability? How does employee strength affect the revenue made by the company? Is profit a good and only factor for estimating the stock price of the company?
